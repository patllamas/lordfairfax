## Lord Fairfax Pet Motel

#### My solo project for Coding Dojo was creating Lord Fairfax Pet Motel, a fullly featured full stack website that allowed users to sign up, add pets, and book different motel suites for each pets' needs.

Challenges: Iterating through lists as a greenhorn developer threw me in for a loop (no pun intended). 

If I could go back and redo the website, I would have freshened up the CSS. Designing the layout with my graphics designer friends helped me realize that I enjoyed coding the front end more than the back end. A good friend of mine suggested the idea of a pet motel and I'm glad to have gone with it.

Technologies: Django, Python, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
